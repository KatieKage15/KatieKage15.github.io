For my Sinatra project I chose to use my full time job as a template. I work in the Aquatics department at non-profit where we teach swim lessons to children. This made it easy with the associations that instructors have many swimmers while swimmers belongs to instructors.

In the app an instructor can either sign up as a new user or log in as a current user. Once logged in then the app will show a list of swimmers for that specific instructor. The logged in instructor will then be able to add a new swimmer or edit a current one with the name, age and any notes they would like to add about their swimmer's swim skills. 

The app is programmed so that only that specific instructor is able to see their own swimmers. I have used an authentication method so that in order to log in the user needs to enter all the correct information and are not able to leave any blank contents. 

Enjoy!
