This project was a continuation of the previous rails project. You have instructors who have many clients and clients that belong to an instructor. 

I used Javascrip to render a show and an index page without a refresh. A user is able to add a new instructor, click on a specific instructor's name and see what their bio says and the name of the clients they have.
