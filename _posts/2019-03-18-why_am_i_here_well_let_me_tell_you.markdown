Back in college I started as a Computer Science major so took a couple of basic coding classes, but then switched over to Graphic Design and continued that route. I received a Bachelor's in Graphic Design and moved down to the city about 6 years ago. 


I have been working at a non-profit for those last 6 years. It has been a really great company to work for, however there is no longer any room for growth. My partner had got an invitation to an Out-In-Tech event where the Flatiron school was hosting. I excitedly went and connected with some really great people. They spoke about the Software Engineering Bootcamp and that you were able to apply right then and there. I decided why not give it a shot and I got accepted. It was very excited as I've always enjoyed coding and this was a great opportunity that feels like was just dropped on my path. 

I love to learn and create. I'm really delighted to continue in the course and come out a better coder on the other side!
